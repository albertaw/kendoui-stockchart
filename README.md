# Kendo UI StockChart for Vue

## Overview

The KendoUI StockChart component is a candlestick chart that visualizes stock data. A candlestick shows the open, high, low, and close values for a stock. It has a solid portion that is the body and two wicks extending above and below the body. The body shows the range between the open and close price. The top of the upper wick represents the highest trading price. The bottom of the lower wick is the lowest trading price. Candlestick charts are used to analyze patterns in price movements such as upward trends and downward trends. This demo shows a stock chart for Amazon stock.
